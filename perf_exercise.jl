# ECON 5010 — Performance Optimization Exercise
# ------------------------------------------------
# Every function below computes something simple and correct, but each
# one is written in a way that makes Julia run much slower than it
# needs to.
#
# YOUR TASK:
#   1. Run `main()` once and note the @time output (baseline).
#   2. Profile the code — use @time / @btime (BenchmarkTools.jl),
#      @code_warntype, and/or @allocated / --track-allocation — to find
#      the bottlenecks in each function.
#   3. Rewrite each function so it runs faster and allocates less
#      memory, WITHOUT changing what it computes. (Your output values
#      should match the originals.)
#   4. Be ready to explain, for each fix: what was slow, why, and how
#      you fixed it.
#
# Hints on what to look for (this is most of what you'll need to know
# about Julia performance):
#   - Non-constant global variables
#   - Containers that don't have a concrete element type
#   - Allocating memory inside a loop when you don't need to
#   - Copying data (e.g. via slicing) when a view would do
#   - Growing a plain array one element at a time
#   - Type instability (a variable that can hold more than one type)
#
# You will not need every hint for every function.
